    Welcome to our AWS Bedrock image generation application. This tool allows you to explore and compare 
    two powerful AI image generation models: Stability.ai's SDXL 1.0 Image Generator and Amazon's Titan Image Generator G1.
    Both are available through AWS Bedrock, providing advanced image generation capabilities.
    
    Here's how you can use this application:
    
    1. Select your image generation model on the side bar (SDXL, Titan)
    2. Create or select a session under the image generator model
    3. Generate or upload your base/starting image
    4. Create variations of your image
    5. Edit the image by drawing on it
    6. Switch between your base, variation, and editing steps
    6. For a simplified experience, try Titan Image Chat Editor to use mask prompts
    7. Manage your automatically saved sessions for each of your projects
    
    You can iterate through these steps as many times as you like, refining your image until you achieve the desired result.
