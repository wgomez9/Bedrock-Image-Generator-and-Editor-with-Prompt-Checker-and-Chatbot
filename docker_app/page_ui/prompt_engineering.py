        ### Image Generation
        - Start prompts with "An image of..." for better context setting
        - Provide detailed descriptions, including medium, color, lighting, style, and quality
        - Use specific prompts and consider negative prompts when applicable
        - Avoid negative words in negative text prompts (e.g, Instead of "no mirrors", just type "mirrors")
        - Use double quotes for text within images (e.g., "An image of a sign that says "Hello"")

        ### Image Variation
        - Intended to generate a new image that preserves the content of the input image but varies it a little. 
        - Describe the original image accurately in the prompt
        - Specify details you want to preserve from the original image
        - At minimum, describe the main object(s) of interest in the scene
        - More detailed and richer prompts help preserve more elements from the original image
        - Avoid describing elements not present in the original image
        - Adjust Similarity Strength if the image is too different or alike to the original image

        ### Inpainting and Outpainting
        - For inpainting object removal, use an empty text prompt
        - For inpainting object replacement, be precise about what to reconstruct, including unique features
            - Optionally include context/background details for more realistic reconstruction
        - For outpainting, provide a detailed description of the desired background
            - Sometimes describe the whole scene, including objects inside the mask, for better results
        - Adjust brush size, stroke color, and fill color for precise masking

        ### Mask Prompt
        - Be precise and detailed about the object(s) to segment
        - Specify unique attributes/features to focus the segmentation algorithm
        - For complex scenes, use specific descriptors to isolate the desired object

        ### General Tips
        - Effective prompts tend to be detailed but not overly long, providing key visual features, styles, emotions or other descriptive elements
        - Adjust cfg_scale to control prompt adherence and ensure good constrainment of the model
        - Use a seed of zero to randomize the seed and get different results almost every time a new image is generated without changing the settings

        ### Image Generation
        - Start prompts with the subject, then add detailed imagery, environment, mood, and style
        - Experimnt with resolutions; wider aspect ratios often yield more realistic human faces
        - Add negative prompts without negative words
        - Avoid conflicting styles such as putting "pixel art" in the text prompt and "photographic" as the style preset

        ### Image Variation
        - Adjust Image Strength if the image is too different or alike to the original image
        - Provide a text prompt to guide the direction of the variation

        ### Image Editing
        - Be precise about what to reconstruct inside the mask region
        - Include context/background details for more realistic reconstruction
        - Adjust brush size, stroke color, and fill color for precise masking
        - Higher cfg scale and step values often yield better results for inpainting
        - For more consistent results, keep the same style preset across the steps or select none
        - If an edit failed, focus on increasing steps, redrawing the mask, wording the prompt differently, and adjusting cfg scale (iterate and refine)

        ### General Tips
        - Effective prompts tend to be detailed but not overly long, providing key visual features, styles, emotions or other descriptive elements
        - Adjust cfg_scale to control prompt adherence and ensure good constrainment of the model
        - Use a seed of zero to randomize the seed and get different results almost every time a new image is generated without changing the settings
        - Experiment with different samplers and clip guidance preset options for varied results
        - Use higher step values (e.g., 50-150) for more refined outputs, balancing quality and generation time
        - Experiment with style presets: 'Photographic' and 'Cinematic' styles often work well for realistic human faces
